studyData,Latitude,Latitude of the site or centroid if multiple sites in decimal degrees.  Multiple sites are separated by a semi-colon.
studyData,Longitude,Longitude of the site or centroid if multiple sites in decimal degrees.  Multiple sites are separated by a semi-colon.
studyData,Elevation,"the elevation of the site, or average elevation across multiple sites, in meters. Multiple sites are separated by a semi-colon."

studyData,Domesticated grazer species,were there domesticated grazers present in the study area (yes or no)
studyData,Plant community origin,The status of the plant community as either: 1) P = planted/seeded or 2) SA = allowed to self assemble

grazingData,SiteID,ID given within the paper for a specific site studied
grazingData,Year,what year was the site studied
grazingData,Replicate,number of replicates of the site treatments in the study
grazingData,Grazing comparison,Determination of the grazing contrast was based on a gradient of intensity (e.g. stocking rate) or a contrast between ordinal groups such as grazed vs. ungrazed. 
grazingData,Grazing level,Grazing categories or comparisons for ordinal contrasts. Only applicable for the ordinal/binary compare
grazingData,Years grazed,how many years had the landscape been grazed when the study was performed

grazingData,Grazing value,"for the specified site, what was the value of the grazing estimate determined"
grazingData,Statistic,"The statistic used to summarize the response of the speciman (e.g. mean, median, standard error).  If listed as ""count"" this represents the plot-level measurement of individuals"
grazingData,Value,The measured value of the responding specimen
